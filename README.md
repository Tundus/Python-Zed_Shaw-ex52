# Python-Zed_Shaw-ex52

As it says on the the tin box. This code is a realisation of Zed Shaw's exercise #52 in his book Learn Python 3 the Hard Way.

In this exercise,  we won't make a complete game, but instead we make an engine that can run the game from Exercise #47 in the browser. This will involve refractoring Exercise #43, mixing in the structure Exercise #47, adding autmated tests, and finally creating a web engine that can run the games.
