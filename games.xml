            <description>
                The Gothons of Planet Percal #25 have
                invaded your ship and destroyed your entire crew.
                You are the last surviving member and your last mission
                is to get neutron destruct bomb from the weapon armory,
                put it in the bridge, and blow the ship up after getting
                into the escape pod.

                Your are running down the central corridor to the Weapons
                Armory when a Gothon jumps out, red scaly skin, dark grimy
                teeth, and evil clown costume flowing around his hate filled
                body. He's blocking the door to the the Armory and about to
                pull a weapon  to blast you.

                Lucky for you they made you learn Gothon insults in the academy.  You
                tell the one Gothon joke you know: 'Lbhe zbgure vf fb sng, jura fur fvgf
                nebhaq gur ubhfr, fur fvgf nebhaq gur ubhfr.' The Gothon stops, tries
                not to laugh, then bursts out laughing and can't move.  While he's
                laughing you run up and shoot him square in the head putting him down,
                then jump through the Weapon Armory door.

                You do a dive roll into the Weapon Armory, crouch and scan the room for
                more Gothons that might be hiding.  It's dead quiet, too quiet.  You
                stand up and run to the far side of the room and find the neutron bomb
                in its container.  There's a keypad lock on the box and you need the
                code to get the bomb out.  If you get the code wrong 10 times then the
                lock closes forever and you can't get the bomb.  The code is 3 digits.

            <description>
                The container clicks open and the seal breaks, letting gas out. You grab
                the neutron bomb and run as fast as you can to the bridge where you must 
                place it in the right spot.

                You burst on to the Bridge with the neutron distruct bomb under your
                arm and surprise five Gothons who are trying to take control of the ship.
                Each of them have an even uglier costume than the last. They haven't pulled 
                their weapons out yet, as they see the active bomb under your arm and
                don't want to set it off.

            <description>
                You point your blaster at the bomb under your arm and the Gothons put
                their hands up and start to sweat. You inch backward to the door, 
                open it, and then carefully place the bomb on the floor, pointing your 
                blaster at it. You then jump back through the door, punch the close 
                button and blast the lock so the Gothon can't get out. Now that the bomb
                is placed you run to the escape pod to get off this tin can.

                You rush through the ship desperately trying to make it to the escape pod
                before the whole ship explodes. It seems like hardly any Gothons are on the ship,
                so your run is clear with interference. You get to the chamber with the escape pods,
                and now you need to pick one to take. Some of them could be damaged but you don/'t
                have time to look. There is five pods, which one do you take?

                You jump into your choosen pod and hit the eject button. The pod easily slides
                out into space heading to the planet below. As it flies to the planet,
                you look back see your ship implode then explode like a bright star,
                taking out the Gothon ship at the same time. You won!

                You jump into a random pod and hit the eject button. The pod escapes
                out into the void of space, then implodes as the hull ruptures, 
                crushing your body into jam jelly.
